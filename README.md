Starting point was Google Merchant Feeder:
https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1375
which is listed as 1.4.7, but actually is 1.14.7.

2020/10: I'm currently revising this (still for ZC156)....but should be still working in the meantime...Caveat Emptor.
No significant functionality changes to 1.14.7, yet.

DO NOT TRY OUT ON A PRODUCTION SITE!!
