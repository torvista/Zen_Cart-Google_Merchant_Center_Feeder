Starting point was Google Merchant Feeder:
https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1375
which is listed as 1.4.7, but actually is 1.14.7.

2020/10: I'm currently revising this (still for ZC156) as necessary, and lots that is not "necessary".
As yet there are no significant functionality changes here to 1.14.7. so if yours is working for you, leave it alone and don't bother with this until I remove this message.

However if there is something wrong with the "1.4.7" version that has come to light with your store, please mention it in an issue and add your solution if you did one.

Bugs Fixed

SQL OFFSET could be used without LIMIT.
