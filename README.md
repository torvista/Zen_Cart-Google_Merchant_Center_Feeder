Starting point was Google Merchant Feeder:
https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1375
which is listed as 1.4.7, but actually is 1.14.7.

2020/10: I'm currently revising this (still for ZC156) as necessary, and lots that is not "necessary".
As yet there are no significant functionality changes here to 1.14.7. so if yours is working for you, leave it alone and don't bother with this until I remove this message.

2020/11: This is on hold for the moment as a GMC crawl of my products structured data is a better bet so I'm expanding that for my primary language. I'll need this feed to add a secondary language and so will come back to this at some point....  

However if there is something wrong with the "1.4.7" version that has come to light with your store, please mention it in an issue and add your solution if you did one.

Bugs Fixed

SQL OFFSET was used without LIMIT.

Much tightening up as per IDE inspections.
