Starting point was Google Merchant Feeder:

which is listed as 1.4.7, but actually is 1.14.7.

2020/10: I'm currently revising this (still for ZC156)....but it should still be working in the meantime...caveat emptor, as always.
As yet there are no significant functionality changes here to 1.14.7. So don't bother trying it yet.

DO NOT TRY OUT ON A PRODUCTION SITE!!
